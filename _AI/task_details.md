# Instructions for Editing This File

- Keep the current concise, high-level style. Focus only on important details.
- Always sort the Plan & Progress section with finished (checked) items at the top, pending below.
- The Plan & Progress section should closely mirror the commit history: each step should include its implementation and required unit tests in a single commit and checkbox.
- Unit tests are required for every main step and must be committed together with the implementation.
- Avoid making changes to already completed (checked) items unless absolutely necessary.
- When adding, removing, or reordering tasks or sub-tasks, always update their numbers to remain sequential and logically consistent.

# SFE Tech Task â€“ Progress & Plan

## Project Overview

- Angular frontend (modern, standalone, signals)
- Node.js backend (in-memory DB)
- Auth and user management flows

## Requirements

- Auth: Store token after login, share with API calls, protect user routes
- Users: Fully functional create/edit form, validation (required, custom: block 'test' in name), loading & error states
- Fix any subtle bugs in logic or API integration
- Bonus: Unit tests, UI/UX improvements
- Clean, clear git history. Small commits .

## Current Understanding

- State managed via facade/store/service pattern
- Auth and user APIs scaffolded, need integration polish

## Plan & Progress

### 1. Project Setup & Code Quality

- [x] 1.1 Initial project review and setup
- [x] 1.2 Code style and formatting configuration
- [x] 1.3 Fix failing creation/unit tests for basic components/services
  - [x] 1.3.1 Provide HttpClient in tests for AuthService, UsersService, UsersFacadeService, UserFormPageComponent, UsersListPageComponent
  - [x] 1.3.2 Fix AppComponent title and render test expectations

### 2. Authentication Flow

**See: [Token Storage Research & Decision](token_storage_research.md)**

- [ ] 2.1 Token storage and sharing (frontend-only, no backend changes)
  - [x] 2.1.1 Store token in sessionStorage after login using a dedicated Angular service
  - [x] 2.1.2 Use an Angular Http Interceptor to automatically attach the token from sessionStorage to all API calls
  - [x] 2.1.3 Clear the token from sessionStorage on logout
- [ ] 2.2 Route protection
  - [ ] 2.2.1 Implement route guards using a functional CanActivate guard (not class-based), leveraging Angular's inject() API for DI. This approach follows the latest Angular best practices for route protection.
  - [ ] 2.2.2 Unit tests for route protection

### 3. User Management

- [ ] 3.1 User form create/edit logic
  - [ ] 3.1.1 Implement create user logic
  - [ ] 3.1.2 Implement edit user logic
  - [ ] 3.1.3 Unit tests for form logic
- [ ] 3.2 Form validation
  - [ ] 3.2.1 Required fields validation
  - [ ] 3.2.2 Custom validator: block 'test' in name (match backend validation)
  - [ ] 3.2.3 Unit tests for validation
- [ ] 3.3 Loading & error states
  - [ ] 3.3.1 Show loading indicators
  - [ ] 3.3.2 Show error messages
  - [ ] 3.3.3 Unit tests for loading/error states

### 4. Improvements

- [ ] 4.1 UI/UX polish (bonus)
- [ ] 4.2 Additional unit tests (bonus)

### 5. Git & Submission

- [x] 5.1 Git commit guidelines
  - [x] 5.1.1 Start with an initial empty commit
  - [x] 5.1.2 Use small, clear commits for each sub-task
  - [ ] 5.1.3 End with a final commit when finished
